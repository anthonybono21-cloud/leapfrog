## The Problem

Playwright MCP sends **~14,000 tokens** for a content-heavy page like Hacker News. Most of that is noise. Your context window fills up. Your agent gets confused. You pay for it.

Leapfrog sends **~1,400 tokens**. Same page. Same information. Up to 10x less noise.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Playwright MCP                                     │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          tokens per page (Hacker News, real test)
```

Savings range from 2-10x depending on page complexity. Content-heavy pages see the biggest wins. Dense forms see the smallest. The median across real-world sites is **~4-5x**.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx leapfrog --doctor          # verify everything works
npx leapfrog --stealth-audit   # test all 19 stealth patches
npx leapfrog --config          # print MCP config to paste
```

Add to `~/.mcp.json` (Claude Code) or your editor's MCP config:

```json
{
  "leapfrog": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "leapfrog"],
    "env": {
      "LEAP_MAX_SESSIONS": "15",
      "LEAP_TILE": "true",
      "LEAP_HUD": "true",
      "LEAP_SOUND": "true",
      "LEAP_AUTO_CONSENT": "true"
    }
  }
}
```

Leapfrog uses `playwright-core` (15MB) instead of `playwright` (1.6GB) and does **not** bundle a browser. Either:
- Set `LEAP_CHANNEL=chrome` to use your installed Chrome/Chromium
- Or run `npx playwright-core install chromium` to install the bundled Chromium binary

## Stealth

Leapfrog ships 19 anti-detection patches enabled by default (`LEAP_STEALTH=true`). These cover the vectors that fingerprint services like CreepJS and fingerprint-pro actually check:

- Client Hints brands (strips HeadlessChrome)
- `navigator.webdriver` forced to `undefined`
- WebGL vendor/renderer (replaces SwiftShader with real GPU strings)
- Connection RTT (non-zero)
- Alert dismiss timing (human-speed delay)
- Window outer/inner height offset
- MIME type array population
- Platform inference from user agent
- `chrome.app` emulation
- iframe `contentWindow` protection
- Media codec spoofing (`canPlayType`)
- `document.hasFocus()` override
- Source URL comment stripping
- Custom UA + stealth coexistence (custom user agents no longer disable stealth context)
- CDP `Runtime.enable` detection (`Error.prepareStackTrace` filter)
- Permissions API spoofing (20+ permission types)
- AudioContext fingerprint noise (`getChannelData`/`getFloatFrequencyData`)
- WebRTC IP leak prevention (ICE candidate filtering)
- Font enumeration fingerprint spoofing

Per-session stealth control: pass `stealth: false` in `session_create` to disable for a specific session.

## Humanization (Experimental)

Set `LEAP_HUMANIZE=true` to enable human-like browser interaction. This is opt-in and adds latency in exchange for more realistic behavior. Six modules:

- **Mouse** — Bezier curve paths with Fitts's Law timing and micro-tremor jitter
- **Typing** — Log-normal inter-key delays (200ms median), key dwell time, bigram-aware speed, rollover typing
- **Scroll** — Inertial simulation with ramp-up and momentum decay (touchpad/mouse-wheel physics)
- **Pause** — Inter-action "think" delays that simulate cognitive gaps between actions
- **Fingerprint** — Coherent browser fingerprint generation (platform, device memory, GPU, timezone)
- **Utils** — Shared math primitives (Box-Muller gaussian, distributions)

## Page Classification

Every `navigate` and `snapshot` call automatically classifies the page type using weighted signal scoring (no LLM required). 18 types:

`login` · `search-results` · `product` · `product-list` · `checkout` · `article` · `dashboard` · `form` · `error` · `challenge` · `landing` · `documentation` · `profile` · `media` · `feed` · `qa` · `ecommerce` · `unknown`

Classification drives smarter snapshot extraction — login pages surface form fields, articles surface content, dashboards surface interactive elements.

## Harness Intelligence

The harness tracks every action in a session and classifies outcomes:

- **Action outcome classification** — `SUCCESS`, `SILENT_CLICK`, `NAVIGATION`, `WRONG_ELEMENT`, `BLOCKED`, `ERROR`, `PENDING`
- **Bot redirect detection** — detects when a site redirects to a challenge or block page after an action
- **Loop detection** — warns when the agent is stuck clicking the same element, ping-ponging between URLs, or repeating actions
- **Session memory** — `session_memory` tool recalls actions after context window compression

## Cookie Persistence

Persistent browser profiles now use `context.cookies()` + `addCookies()` instead of `storageState()`, which returns empty on persistent contexts. Auth state survives across sessions.

## Adaptive Wait + Stealth Escalation

Navigate automatically retries with fallback strategies when pages fail to load:

1. Try `load` (fastest) — if empty, retry with `networkidle` (10s cap)
2. If `networkidle` times out (Amazon, ad-heavy sites), fall back to `domcontentloaded`
3. If blocked/challenged, escalate stealth: random delays → wait for JS challenge → rotate session with fresh fingerprint
4. Profile sessions (auth'd) never have their session destroyed — hard-capped at Level 2

Opt-out with `autoRetry: false` on `navigate`. Control max escalation with `maxRetryLevel` (0-5, default 3).

## Record / Replay

Export a session's action history as a replayable recording, then replay it in new sessions:

- **`session_export`** — creates parameterized JSON or Playwright script from session history. `@eN` refs resolved to stable CSS selectors. Auto-detects emails, passwords, URLs as `{{placeholders}}`.
- **`session_replay`** — replays a recording with parameter overrides. Supports `onError: 'stop'` or `'skip'`.

Turn one-off agent workflows into reusable automations.

## Pagination Extraction

Extract data across multiple pages in a single tool call:

- **Click-next** — auto-detects "Next" buttons, pagination links, "Load more" buttons
- **Infinite scroll** — scrolls and waits for new content via DOM hash comparison
- **URL pattern** — increments `?page={page}` or custom patterns

Replaces 3-4 tool calls per page. Cap: 50 pages, 100K total chars. Stops on: no next button, empty page, duplicate content, or bot detection.

## Incremental Snapshots

The `diff` tool returns only what changed since the last snapshot — additions, removals, changes. Massive token savings for monitoring and polling workflows.

## HUD Overlays (`LEAP_HUD=true`)

When running headed, Leapfrog overlays visual feedback on every session:

- **Color-coded border** — 3px edge: green=active, blue=loading, amber=waiting, red=error
- **Status bar** — session name + status (bottom-left, semi-transparent)
- **Agent cursor** — green dot that CSS-glides to click targets
- **Click ripple** — expanding green circle at click coordinates (agent actions only)

Makes it trivial to see what the agent is doing across tiled sessions.

## Human Intervention

Leapfrog auto-detects situations that need a human — CAPTCHAs, login forms, OAuth redirects, Cloudflare challenges — and pauses the agent until you handle it.

- Detects reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, Turnstile, login forms, OAuth redirects, Cloudflare challenges
- Fullscreen `@..@` overlay with reason text + "Done" button
- Sound chime + macOS notification on detection
- `wait_for_human` tool — agent calls when stuck, blocks until you click Done

## Cookie Consent Auto-Dismiss (`LEAP_AUTO_CONSENT=true`)

Automatically dismisses cookie consent banners across 10 frameworks (OneTrust, CookieBot, TrustArc, Quantcast, Didomi, Cookielaw, Osano, Usercentrics, + generic) plus text-matching fallback. Per-domain selector caching for instant replay on revisit.

## Tracing (`LEAP_TRACE=true`)

Per-session Playwright tracing with screenshots + DOM snapshots. Export ZIP files viewable at `trace.playwright.dev` via the `session_export_trace` tool. Auto-saves on session destroy.

## Self-Improvement

Leapfrog learns from experience. Per-domain knowledge stored at `~/.leapfrog/domains/`:

- **Wait strategy learning** — records which wait method worked per domain + running average timing
- **Stealth tier learning** — auto-escalates after blocks, starts at the learned tier on revisit
- **API endpoint caching** — remembers discovered endpoints for faster API intelligence
- LRU eviction at 500 domains. Inspect with the `domain_knowledge` tool.

## SSRF Hardening

URL validation blocks hex-encoded IPs (`0x7f000001`), octal notation (`0177.0.0.1`), CGNAT ranges (`100.64.0.0/10`), and redirect chains that resolve to internal addresses. Localhost and `127.0.0.0/8` are allowed by default for local dev workflows — set `LEAP_BLOCK_LOCALHOST=true` to block them.

## The Ecosystem

Leapfrog uses pond metaphors to keep things memorable. Your agent is the frog.

| Concept | Leapfrog term | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Sessions | **Ponds** | Isolated browser contexts — cookies, storage, state |
| Tabs | **Lily pads** | Where the frog lands within a pond |
| Navigate | **Leap** | Jump to a URL, get a compact snapshot back |
| Snapshots | **Surface** | What you see on the surface — interactive `@eN` refs |
| Network traffic | **Ripple** | HTTP requests flowing under the surface |
| Console errors | **Croak** | Something went wrong in the browser |
| Stealth mode | **Camouflage** | Anti-bot evasion patches |
